### Translations

We’d really love to encourage and help share translations of the white paper to the global WordPress community. If you have a translation to contribute, please add it to the WordPress GitHub repo so others can benefit, too. [Pull requests](https://github.com/WordPress/Security-White-Paper/pulls) welcome!

To translate the white paper, please create a sub-directory of the project under Working Translations, giving it the correct ISO639 code (for example, pt for Portuguese), and submit a pull request. Once the translation has reached a release / first full translation, we'll move it to its own subdirectory at the top level, and subsequent updates will happen in that location.
